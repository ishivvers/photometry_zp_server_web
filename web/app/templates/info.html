	  <h3>Photometric Estimates</h3>
	   <p>This site was designed to produce accurate estimates of the 
		  photometric zeropoint between a set of observations (instrumental magnitudes)
		  and the standard photometric systems of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdss.org/">SDSS</a>, 
	 	  <a target="_blank" href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/ub1.html">USNOB1</a>, and 
 	      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/overview/about2mass.html">2-MASS</a>.
		  To do this, I pull observations from the SDSS catalog 
		  (if within <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/coverage/">the SDSS footprint</a>)
		  or from the all-sky USNO-B1 catalog, cross-match them to sources in the all-sky 2-MASS catalog,
		  and then fit a model spectra from the 
		  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/pickles_atlas.html">Pickles Stellar Atlas</a>
		  to each source. This produces an estimate for the spectrum for each individual source,
		  from which I then produce synthetic photometry for all requested bands. These photometric estimates
		  can then be used to calculate a systematic offset between observed magnitudes (e.g. the instrumental
		  magnitudes generated through photometry) and the true magnitudes for a set of observations;
		  i.e. the photometric zeropoint.
	   </p>
	  <h3>Characteristic Errors</h3>
	   <p>Though the estimates for individual sources can sometimes be off by as much
		  as .5 mag, I have worked to get the mean offset for any ensemble of
		  sources as close to zero as possible. <br>
		  When using SDSS (e.g. to predict y-band within the SDSS footprint), 
		  characteristic errors of individual sources are of order <b>.10 mag</b>, and
		  errors of the mean offset for all sources in field are of order <b>.05 mag</b>.

		<br>
		  When using USNO-B1 (e.g. to predict the SDSS magnitudes outside the SDSS footprint),
		  characteristic errors of individual sources are of order <b>.20 mag</b>, and
		  errors of the mean offset for all sources in field are of order <b>.05 mag</b>.

		  <b>Note:</b> estimates for the bluer bands (<i>u, g, r</i>) produced from USNO-B1 values very near the galactic plane
		  are systematically worse than those presented above - approaching .2 mag (for the mean offset) within 5&deg; of the plane.
		  This is probably due to galactic reddening by interstellar dust, but I am, as yet, unable to get rid
		  of the problem.
		  For now, I'd recommend against using <i>u, g,</i> or <i>r</i> estimates by the PhotoZP Estimator closer than 10&deg;
		  away from the galactic plane.
