# PhotoZPE Webserver #

This is a repository containing the now-defunct code used
to host a local webservice providing access to an instance
of [the photometric zeropoint server](https://github.com/ishivvers/photometry_zeropoint_server).
It expects, on the server running this webservice, an installation of that package.

It was developed as part of my graduate work at UC Berkeley and is here
released for anyone to use under the MIT licence.
